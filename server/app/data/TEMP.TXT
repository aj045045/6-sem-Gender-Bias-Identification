@UniversalORL it is 2021 not 1921. I dont appreciate that on two rides by myself your team member looked behind me and asked the man behind how many in my party. Not impressed #everydaysexism,

According to a customer I have plenty of time to go spent the Stirling coins he wants to pay me with, in Derry. \Just like any other woman, I'm sure of it.\ #EveryDaySexism in retail.,

#EverydaySexism We can &amp; need to do better https://t.co/RePR48B0xv,

@orlamuldoon @NWCI @IrishRunnerMag @ReclaimTS @EverydaySexism @SAFEIreland @Womens_Aid Hi Orla. Interesting piece. On No 2. As a policy response, do you believe early-in-life prosecution and punishment is the way to go with boys, young men when they offend against girls and women? Is this how you see by a zero tolerance approach being instituted?,

@oliophi You have rage issues that manifest in an internet addiction. It at least started outwardly during gamergate and when that died you needed a new fix, you already had your views on trans people but we became the new vessel for your anger.You need help.,

@CharmedDegen @garddensong argue that you can be sexually harassed online? bc I've had it happen?,

@okhvii @jouwswa @Ninja @CouRageJD Bro you just harassed him,

No two completely different situations, teacher had broken up the fight, it was over. Simpkins went to his bag, pulled out his handgun and fired. Simpkins claimed he was being harassed but the police have stated this was gang related. So good try but no dice. https://t.co/PxpO2CCiN3,

No child will ever walk 10km to school. Gogos (Makhulu) won't hire bakkies for clinic visits, motorists won't have to drive to town for fuel etcNB: Not meant to offended anyone, its merely a suggestion. I stand to be corrected!!!#noonestaysbehind #weareequal,
